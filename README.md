# AMK ProductionðŸš€
Delighted to unveil the latest milestone in my journey - AMKProduction, a dynamic React.js project. From envisioning its design on Figma to bringing it to life with React.js for frontend and Next.js for backend, every step has been a testament to my passion for full-stack development. Join me on this adventure, explore the website, and share your feedback! #AMKProduction Here are some Screenshots of the Webapp#ReactJS #FullStackDevelopment #WebDesign

## System Requirements
To run this ReactJS project, your system should meet the following requirements:

* Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
* Node.js: v12.x or higher
* npm: v6.x or higher (comes bundled with Node.js)
* RAM: At least 4GB
* Disk Space: At least 1GB free space
# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Node.js and npm. You can download them from Node.js official website.
* You have a code editor installed, such as Visual Studio Code.

## Installation
Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
## Navigate to the project directory

```sh
cd your-repo-name
```

## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

* Running the Application
* Start the development server

```sh
npm start
```
This will run the application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build the application for production

```sh
npm run build
```
This will create a build directory with the production build of your application. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Additional Scripts
Test the application

```sh
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

Eject the application

```sh
npm run eject
```

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back! It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project, so you have full control over them. If you arenâ€™t sure why you need this, you probably donâ€™t.
